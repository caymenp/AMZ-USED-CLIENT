ReactJS application that interacts with custom built backend server. This application allows users to add Amazon products to track. This is different from your every day price trackers. This application isn't interested in the very visable price that is listed on Amazon. This application dives into the USED and Amazon Warehouse deals that aren't so easy to find while browsing. 

Once an item is added, users see the product in their dashboard. Where they see the current "new" price, and the lowest price found for this product in the Amazon Warehoust deals & used listings. It shows the discount % the user is saving, and allows them to easily navigate to Amazon to checkout.

The application will check automatically with Amazon to determine if a new listing has been added to the used or warehouse deals. If so, and that price is lower, it will update the user with an email alert!
